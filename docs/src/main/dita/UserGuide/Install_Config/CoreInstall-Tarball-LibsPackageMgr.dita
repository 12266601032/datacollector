 <title>Install Additional Libraries Using the Package Manager</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>core tarball install<indexterm>installing additional
                libraries</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Package Manager<indexterm>installing
                    additional libraries</indexterm></indexterm>You can use the Package Manager
            within <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            install additional tarball libraries to use stages that are not included in the core
            installation. This is an optional step, but generally you'll want to install additional
            libraries to process data.</p>
        <note>You must perform additional steps to install the MapR or Apache Solr stage libraries.
            For more information, see <xref href="MapR-Prerequisites.dita#concept_jgs_qpg_2v"/> or
                <xref href="../Destinations/Solr-Prerequisites.dita#concept_gm2_y12_pw"/>.</note>
        <p>Click the <uicontrol>Package Manager</uicontrol> icon <image
                href="../Graphics/icon_PackageManager.png" scale="80" id="image_rt4_qsl_nx"/> to
            display the Package Manager. The Package Manager lists all available stage libraries,
            displaying a checkbox next to each one installed in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>.
            You can filter the stage libraries by type or you can search for a stage library in the
            list.</p>
        <p>For information about the stages installed with each stage library, see <xref
                href="CoreInstall-LibList.dita"/>.</p>
        <p>For example, the following image displays three installed stage libraries:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/PackageManager.png" scale="70" id="image_gct_3vl_nx"/></p>
        <p>To install an additional stage library, click the <uicontrol>More</uicontrol> icon for
            the library, and then click <uicontrol>Install</uicontrol>. Or to install multiple stage
            libraries, select the libraries in the list and then click the
                <uicontrol>Install</uicontrol> icon <image href="../Graphics/icon_InstallLib.png"
                scale="70" id="image_z4c_s3m_nx"/>. Confirm that you want to install the libraries,
            and then restart Data Collector for the changes to take effect.</p>
        <p>To uninstall a stage library, click the <uicontrol>More</uicontrol> icon for the library,
            and then click <uicontrol>Uninstall</uicontrol>. Or to uninstall multiple stage
            libraries, select the libraries in the list and then click the
                <uicontrol>Uninstall</uicontrol> icon <image
                href="../Graphics/icon_UninstallLib.png" scale="70" id="image_svh_y3m_nx"/>. Confirm
            that you want to uninstall the libraries, and then restart Data Collector for the
            changes to take effect.</p>
