 <title>Metric Alerts</title>
 <shortdesc>Metric alerts are alerts based on pipeline and stage statistics, such as a high rate of
  bad records or a batch of records taking too long to process. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>You can configure metric alerts based on the metric type, the metric, an element associated
   with the metric, and a condition.</p>
  <p>Metric alerts display in the <ph
    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> window in
   Monitoring mode. You can also configure a metric alert to send email to all email addresses
   associated with the pipeline. </p>
  <p>You can configure metric alerts when you configure the pipeline or after you start the
   pipeline. The metric alert takes effect after you enable the alert.</p>
