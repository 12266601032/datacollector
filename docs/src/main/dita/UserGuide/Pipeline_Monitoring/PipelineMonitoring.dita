  <title>Pipeline Monitoring</title>
  <shortdesc>When the <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> runs a
    pipeline, you can view real-time statistics about the pipeline and examine a sampling of the
    data being processed. Monitor a pipeline to verify that the pipeline processes data as expected,
    to view a sample of the current data, or to create alerts.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>When you access the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> window as
      the <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> runs
      a pipeline, the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> window
      displays the pipeline in Monitoring mode. In Monitoring mode, you can perform the following
        tasks:<ul id="ul_c4s_w13_tq">
        <li>View statistics for the pipeline and stages in the pipeline</li>
        <li>Inspect a sampling of data as it passes between two stages and configure alerts</li>
        <li>Review how a snapshot of data moves through the pipeline</li>
      </ul></p>
