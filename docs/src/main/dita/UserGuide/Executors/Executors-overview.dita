 <title>Executors</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>executors<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>An executor stage executes a
            task when it receives an event. Use executor stages as part of an event stream to
            perform event-driven, pipeline-related tasks, such as moving a fully-written file when a
            destination closes it.</p>
        <p>For more information about event handling, see <xref
                href="../Event_Handling/EventHandling-Overview.dita#concept_cph_5h4_lx"/>.</p>
        <p>You can use the following executors in a pipeline:<ul id="ul_htl_4dr_mx">
                <li>HDFS File Metadata - Renames or moves closed files or defines file permissions
                    upon receiving an event record.</li>
                <li>Hive Query - Runs a user-defined Hive or Impala query upon receiving an event
                    record. </li>
                <li>JDBC Query - Runs a user-defined query upon receiving an event record.</li>
                <li>MapReduce - Starts the specified MapReduce job upon receiving an event record. </li>
            </ul></p>
