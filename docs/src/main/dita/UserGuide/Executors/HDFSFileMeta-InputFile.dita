 <title>Input File</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>HDFS File Metadata executor<indexterm>input file</indexterm></indexterm>The
            input file is the file with metadata that you want to change. By default, the HDFS File
            Metadata executor uses the following expression for the input file:
            <codeblock>${record:value('/file_path')}</codeblock></p>
        <p>In this expression, file_path is the field in the event record. The event records
            generated by the Hadoop FS, Local FS, and MapR FS destinations include a file_path field
            that contains the location and name of the files that the destinations close. </p>
        <p>For more information about the event records generated by the destinations, see "Event
            Record" in the destination documentation. </p>
