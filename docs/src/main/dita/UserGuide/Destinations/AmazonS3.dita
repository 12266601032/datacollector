                    S3</indexterm></indexterm>The destination creates a file for each batch of data
            written to the Amazon S3. Output files use the following naming convention:
            <codeblock>&lt;prefix>-&lt;longtimestamp>-&lt;counter></codeblock></p>
        <p>You can configure the prefix. The destination uses "sdc" by default.</p>
  <p>You can optionally use a proxy user and compress data with gzip when writing to Amazon S3.</p>
