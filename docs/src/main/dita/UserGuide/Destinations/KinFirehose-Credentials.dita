     <dl>

             <dt>IAM roles</dt>
             <dd>When Data Collector runs on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can use the AWS Management Console to configure an IAM role for the EC2 instance. Data Collector uses the IAM instance profile credentials to automatically connect to Firehose. For more information about assigning an IAM role to an EC2 instance, see the Amazon EC2 documentation.</dd>

                        instance doesnâ€™t have an IAM role, you must specify the <uicontrol>Access
