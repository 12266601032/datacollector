 <title>Writing Whole Files</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>file name expression<indexterm>writing whole files</indexterm></indexterm>When
            writing whole files, you configure a <uicontrol>File Name Expression</uicontrol>
            property in the destination. The expression defines the name for the target file. </p>
        <p>You can use record:value and string functions in the expression. By default, destinations
            use the following file name expression, which uses the original source file name as the
            target file name:</p>
        <p>
            <codeblock>${record:value('/fileInfo/filename')}</codeblock>
        </p>
        <section>
            <title>Example</title>
            <p>You want a pipeline to pass whole files from a local directory to Amazon S3. For the
                target file name, you want to append the .json file extension to the original file
                name. To do this, you can configure the File Name Expression as follows:
                <codeblock>${str:concat(record:value('/fileInfo/filename'), ".json")}</codeblock></p>
            <p>Or, more
                simply...<codeblock>${record:value('/fileInfo/filenameâ€™)}.json</codeblock></p>
