 <title>Branching Streams</title>
 <shortdesc>When you connect a stage to multiple stages, all data passes to all connected stages.
      You can configure required fields for a stage to discard records before they enter the stage,
      but by default all records are passed.</shortdesc>

          pipeline</indexterm></indexterm>For example, in the following pipeline, all of the data
      from the Directory origin passes to both branches of the pipeline for different types of
      processing. But you might optionally configure required fields for the Field Splitter or Value
      Replacer to discard any records that are not needed.</p>
