 <title>Multiple Offset Value Handling</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>JDBC Multitable Consumer origin<indexterm>multiple offset
                values</indexterm></indexterm>When processing partitions, JDBC Multitable Consumer
            origin allows processing multiple records with the same offset value. For example, the
            origin can process multiple records with the same timestamp in a transaction_date offset
            column.</p>
        <p>
            <note type="warning">When processing multiple records with the same offset value,
                records can be dropped if you stop the pipeline when the origin is processing a
                series of records with the same offset value.</note>
        </p>
        <p>When you stop the pipeline as origin is processing a series of records with the same
            offset value, the origin notes the offset. Then, when you restart the pipeline, it
            starts with a record with the next logical offset value, skipping any unprocessed
            records that use the same last-saved offset. </p>
