 <title>Processing Available Data</title>
 <shortdesc>When you start a pipeline for the first time, the MapR Streams Consumer becomes a new
        consumer group for the topic. It reads only incoming data, processing data from all
        partitions, and ignores any existing data in the topic by default. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>MapR Streams Consumer origin<indexterm>processing all
                data</indexterm></indexterm>To read all unread data in the topic, add the
                <uicontrol>auto.offset.reset</uicontrol> Kafka configuration property. Set the
            property to <uicontrol>smallest</uicontrol> for versions before <ph
