     origin<indexterm>data formats</indexterm></indexterm>The File Tail origin processes data
   differently based on the type of data in the file. File Tail can process the following types of
   data:</p>
  <dl>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>Text</dt>
    <dd>Generates a record for each line in the file. </dd>
    <dd>When a line exceeds the maximum line length defined for the origin, File Tail truncates the
     line.</dd>
   </dlentry>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>JSON</dt>
    <dd>Generates a record for each JSON object. Each JSON object must be written to file as a
     single line.</dd>
    <dd>When an object exceeds the maximum line length defined for the origin, File Tail processes
     the object based on the error handling configured for the origin.</dd>
   </dlentry>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>Log</dt>
    <dd>Generates a record for every log line. </dd>
    <dd>When a line exceeds the maximum line length defined for the origin, File Tail truncates the
     line.</dd>
    <dd>You can include the processed log line as a field in the record. If the log line is
     truncated, and you request the log line in the record, File Tail includes the truncated
     line.</dd>
    <dd>You can define the log format or type to be read.</dd>
