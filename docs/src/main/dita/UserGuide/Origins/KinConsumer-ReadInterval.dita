 <title>Read Interval</title>
 <shortdesc>You can configure the read interval for the Kinesis Consumer. The read interval
  determines how long Kinesis Consumer waits before requesting additional data from Kinesis shards.
  By default, the Kinesis Consumer waits 1000 milliseconds - one second - between requests. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Kinesis Consumer origin<indexterm>read interval</indexterm></indexterm>The minimum
   read interval is 200 milliseconds. Amazon recommends 250 milliseconds. Below that number, you
   might want to create additional shards for the cluster. </p>
  <p>Adjust the read interval to adapt to the Kinesis data load. For example, you might reduce the
   wait time to enable higher throughput or increase the wait time when the stream of data
   slows.</p>
  <p>Use the Read Interval property to define the time between data requests for each shard.</p>
