 <title>Using a Hadoop User</title>
 <shortdesc>You can configure the Hadoop FS origin to use a Hadoop user to read data from HDFS. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Hadoop FS origin<indexterm>using a Hadoop user to write to
        Hadoop</indexterm></indexterm>By default, <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses the
      user account who started it to connect to external systems. When using Kerberos, <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses the
      Kerberos principal. <draft-comment author="Loretta">Make sure updates to this topic go into
        the destination version of the file.</draft-comment></p>
  <p>To use a Hadoop user to connect to HDFS, perform the following tasks:<ol id="ul_mb1_xpt_ls">
        <li>On HDFS, configure the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> user
          as a proxy user and authorize the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> user
          to impersonate the Hadoop user. <p>For more information, see the HDFS documentation.
          </p></li>
        <li>In the Hadoop FS origin, enter the Hadoop user name.</li>
      </ol></p>
