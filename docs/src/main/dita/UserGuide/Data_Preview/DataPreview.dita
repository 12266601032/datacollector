            help you configure the pipeline. After you configure the origin and link the stages that
            you want to review, you start the data preview. </p>
        <p>In preview mode, you cannot add or delete stages, but you can edit stage properties and
            run the preview again to see how your changes affect preview data. Similarly, you can
            edit preview data to test and tune pipeline configuration. </p>
        <p>You can view preview data in list or table view, and for one stage at a time or for a
            group of stages. You can also refresh the preview data.</p>
