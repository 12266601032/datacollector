 <title>Event Records</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>event records<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>Event records are records
            created by a stage when a stage-related event occurs, like when an origin starts reading
            a new file or a destination closes an output file. </p>
        <p>Event records contain general event information in the record header, such as when the
            event occurred. Event-specific details, such as the name and location of the output file
            that was closed, are passed in a record field. </p>
