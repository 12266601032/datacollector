 <title>Tutorial Overview</title>
 <shortdesc>This tutorial walks through how to create and run a pipeline. You can download sample
  data so you can perform data preview, run the completed pipeline, and monitor the results. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>We have a basic and extended version of the tutorial. The basic version allows you to read from
   and write to a local file system so you can easily use the sample data. </p>
  <p>The extended version flattens and manipulates the data before writing to the Trash destination.
   Trash is a development destination that we use to test a pipeline without writing to a
   destination system. If you want, you can write to any destination that works for you. </p>
  <p>The sample data is a file of delimited data that we'll flatten along the way. The <ph
    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses a special
   record format for delimited data. So, in addition to learning some basic <ph
    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> and pipeline
   configuration concepts, you'll see how to manipulate both delimited and flattened data.</p>
  <p>For sample data, the tutorial uses fare payment information from a taxi company. The basic
   pipeline assesses the credit card vendors that customers use so you can decide later if you want
   to end contracts with low volume vendors. The pipeline then masks the credit card numbers before
   writing the results to file. A secondary branch standardizes the record format for non-credit
   card data. </p>
  <p>Here's what we'll create with the basic tutorial:</p>

  <p>The extended pipeline adds an additional branch to flatten the data, convert some field types
   and then write the data to the Trash destination. We'll use data preview to test stage
   configuration and changes in data before we complete the extended pipeline:</p>
