    <title>Write to Trash</title>
    <shortdesc>To wrap up the extended tutorial, configure a destination to write the data to a
        destination system that you use. To write to a file system, you can use the Hadoop FS
        destination like earlier in the tutorial. </shortdesc>

        <context>
            <p>If you don't want to write the tutorial data to any of your systems, you can use the
                Trash destination. The Trash destination deletes any records that pass to it. This
                allows you to complete a pipeline in development so you can test the pipeline
                without writing data to to a production system. </p>

        <result>Here's the full pipeline with a Trash destination:<p><image
