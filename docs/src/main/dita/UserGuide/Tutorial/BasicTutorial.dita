 <title>Basic Tutorial</title>
 <shortdesc>The basic tutorial creates a pipeline that processes data in two branches and writes all
  data to a file system. You'll use data prevew to help configure the pipeline, and you'll create a
  data alert and run the pipeline. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>tutorial<indexterm>basic</indexterm></indexterm>Here are high level steps for
   building and running the basic pipeline:<ol id="ol_emy_rhp_ms">
    <li>Configure pipeline properties, primarily error handling.</li>
    <li>Add a Directory origin to represent the data to be processed. </li>
    <li>Preview source data to determine the field-level details needed for the pipeline.</li>
    <li>Use a Stream Selector to route credit card transactions to the primary branch and cash
     transactions to the secondary branch. We'll define a required field to discard records without
     a payment type.</li>
    <li>Configure a Jython Evaluator to perform custom processing that determines the credit card
     type based on the credit card number. </li>
    <li>Add a Field Masker to mask credit card numbers. Use a required field to discard records
     without credit card numbers.</li>
    <li>In the secondary branch, use an Expression Evaluator to add fields to the cash records to
     match the credit card records. Use data preview to verify the fields to add. </li>
    <li>Connect both branches to a Hadoop FS destination.</li>
    <li>Add a data rule to raise an alert if too many credit card payments are missing credit card
     numbers.</li>
    <li>Start the pipeline and monitor the results.</li>
