    <dt>Why isn't my pipeline reading existing data from my Kafka topic? </dt>
    <dd>By default, the Kafka Consumer reads data written to the topic after you start the pipeline.
     Records already in the topic are ignored. </dd>
    <dd>To read the oldest unread data in a topic, add the <uicontrol>auto.offset.reset</uicontrol>
     Kafka Configuration property to the origin and set it to <uicontrol>smallest</uicontrol>.
      <note>If you already started the pipeline or ran a preview without this option, the offset has
      already been committed. To read the oldest unread data in a topic, set
       <uicontrol>auto.offset.reset</uicontrol> to <uicontrol>smallest</uicontrol> and then
      temporarily change the Consumer Group name to a different value. Run data preview. Then,
      change the Consumer Group back to the correct value and start the pipeline.</note></dd>
