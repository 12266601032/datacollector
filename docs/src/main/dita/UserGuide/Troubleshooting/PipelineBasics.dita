            console, I get a "Webpage not available" error message.</dt>

          <dt>Why isn't the Start icon enabled? </dt>
          <dd>You can start a pipeline when it is valid. Use the Issues icon to review the list of
            issues in your pipeline. When you resolve the issues, the Start icon becomes
            enabled.</dd>

          <dt>Why doesn't the Select Fields with Preview Data option work? No preview data
            displays.</dt>
          <dd>Select Fields with Preview Data can provide preview data when the pipeline is valid
            for data preview. Make sure all stages are connected. You might also need to enter
            temporary values for required properties to enable data preview.</dd>

            <draft-comment author="Loretta">From Hari: "Why is there no data in my pipeline" or "why
              is the throughput very low". User could trouble shoot by looking at the metric charts
              and figure out whether source is producing records or if a stage is taking more
              time.User could follow up by tuning the throughput/latency parameters for origin
              stages [batch size vs batch time] or even tune the external source.</draft-comment>

          <dt>Why isn't the Data Preview icon enabled?</dt>
          <dd>You can preview data after you connect all stages in the pipeline and configure
            required properties. You can use any valid value as a placeholder. </dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Why doesn't the data preview show any data?</dt>
          <dd>If data preview doesn't show any data, one of the following issues might have
              occurred:<ul id="ul_r5n_jgm_2s">
              <li>The origin might not be configured correctly. In the Preview panel, check the
                Issues tab of the origin stage for related issues.</li>
              <li>The origin might not have any data at the moment. </li>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Why can't I edit preview data?</dt>
          <dd>When you can edit preview data in the following locations in a pipeline. <ul
