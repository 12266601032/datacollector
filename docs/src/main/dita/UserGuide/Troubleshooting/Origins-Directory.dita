     <dt>Why isn't the Directory origin reading all of my files?</dt>
     <dd>Directory reads files based on their file name pattern in lexicographic increasing order.
      If new files are not named in lexicographically increasing order, they are not read. </dd>
     <dd>To ensure that newly arrived files are read, make sure the naming convention for the files
      are lexicographically increasing. For example, filename-1.log, filename-2.log, etc. works fine
      until filename-10.log. If filename-10.log arrives after Directory completes reading
      filename-2.log, since it is lexicographically earlier than filename-2.log, it cannot be read
      unless you reset the origin to read all files in the directory.</dd>
     <dd>In this example, you could correct the issue by add leading zeros to the naming convention,
      e.g. filename-00001.log, filename-00002.log,... filename-00009.log, filename-00010.log. This
      works as long as the zeros allow enough padding for the expected number of files.</dd>
