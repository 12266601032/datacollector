 <title>Metric Types</title>
 <shortdesc>Metric alerts provide different types of alerts based on the metric type that you
    select. For example, when you select a counter type, you can create alerts based on the number
    of error records generated by a specific stage. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>metric alerts<indexterm>metric types</indexterm></indexterm>Metric alerts include
      the following metric types:</p>
  <p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Gauge</dt>
          <dd>Provides metric alerts based on the age of the current batch, the amount of time a
            stage takes to process a batch, or the time the <ph
              conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> last
            received a record from the origin.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Counter</dt>
          <dd>Provides metric alerts based on a count of different record types and of stage errors
            for any stage in the pipeline.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Histogram</dt>
          <dd>Provides metric alerts based on a histogram of different record types and stage errors
            for any stage. You can also use batch-based histograms. </dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Meter</dt>
          <dd>Provides metric alerts based on a rates of different record types and stage errors for
            any stage. You can also use batch-based meters.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Timer</dt>
