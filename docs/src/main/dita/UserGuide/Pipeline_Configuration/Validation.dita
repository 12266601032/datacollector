 <title>Validation</title>
 <shortdesc>The <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
  /> console provides two types of validation:</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>
   <dl>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Implicit validation</dt>
     <dd>Implicit validation occurs by default as the console saves your changes. Implicit
      validation lists missing or incomplete configuration, such as an unconnected stage or a
      required property that has not been configured. Implicit validation also lists information
      that uses incorrect syntax, such as the wrong structure for a URI.</dd>
     <dd>Errors found by implicit validation display in the Issues list. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Explicit validation</dt>
     <dd>Explicit validation occurs on demand when you click the Validate icon. Explicit validation
      becomes available when implicit validation passes.</dd>
     <dd>Explicit validation checks all configured values for validity and verifies whether the
      pipeline can run as configured. </dd>
     <dd>For example, while implicit validation checks for the syntax for a URI, explicit validation
      tests the URI by connecting to the system. Similarly, while implicit validation checks
      expression syntax, explicit validation verifies <draft-comment author="Loretta"
