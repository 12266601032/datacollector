 <shortdesc>The <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
  /> console provides two types of validation:</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>
   <dl>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Logical validation</dt>
     <dd>Logical validation occurs by default as the console saves your changes. Logical validation
      lists missing or incomplete configuration, such as an unconnected stage or a required property
      that has not been configured. Logical validation also lists information that uses incorrect
      syntax, such as the wrong structure for a URI.</dd>
     <dd>Errors found by logical validation display in the Issues list. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Semantic validation</dt>
     <dd>Semantic validation occurs on demand when you click the Validate icon. Semantic validation
      becomes available when logical validation passes.</dd>
     <dd>Semantic validation checks all configured values for validity and verifies whether the
      pipeline can run as configured. </dd>
     <dd>For example, while logical validation checks for the syntax for a URI, semantic validation
      tests the URI by connecting to the system. Similarly, while logical validation checks
      expressions for invalid syntax, semantic validation verifies <draft-comment author="Loretta"
       >what's the difference for expressions, or should I use a different example?
