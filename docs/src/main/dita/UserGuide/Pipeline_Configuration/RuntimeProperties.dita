 <title>Runtime Properties</title>
 <shortdesc>Runtime properties are properties that you define in a file local to the <ph
   conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> and call from
  within a pipeline. With runtime properties, you can define different sets of values for the
  properties for different <ph
   conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>runtime properties<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>You can use runtime
   properties to define values for stage and pipeline properties. For example, you can define a
   Error Directory runtime property that points to different directories on a test machine and a
   production machine. Similarly, you might create two sets of runtime properties for the origin and
   destination of a pipeline. </p>
  <p>To implement runtime properties, perform the following steps:<ol id="ol_m24_1bh_1s">
    <li>Define runtime properties. </li>
    <li>Use runtime properties in the pipeline.</li>
   </ol></p>
