  <p>A Kafka Consumer origin stage reads JSON data with a maximum object length of 4096 characters
      and the stage encounters an object with 5000 characters. Based on the stage configuration, the
        <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> either
      discards the record, stops the pipeline, or passes the record to the pipeline for error record
      handling. </p>
  <p>When the stage is configured to send the record to the pipeline, one of the following occurs
   based on how you configure the pipeline error handling: <ul id="ul_a3h_mjy_5r">
    <li>When the pipeline discards error records, the <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> discards the
     record without noting the action or the cause. <p>When you monitor the pipeline, you can view
      the most recent set of error records and information about the errors on the Error Records tab
      for the stage. But this information becomes unavailable after you stop the pipeline. </p></li>
    <li>When the pipeline writes error records to file or Kafka, the <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> writes the
     error record and additional error information to the file or Kafka, respectively. It also
     includes the error records in monitor counts and metrics. </li>
   </ul></p>
