 <title>What is a Pipeline?</title>
 <shortdesc>A pipeline describes the data flow for the <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Configure a pipeline on the <term>pipeline canvas</term>. To configure a pipeline, you add and
      configure an origin stage to represent source data, processor stages to perform processing and
      routing, and one or more destination stages to represent target data. Connect the stages to
      create a data flow from origin to destinations. </p>
    <p>The canvas automatically saves and validates your work. The pipeline canvas provides warnings
      for parts of the pipeline that are not yet complete or valid. You can view a full list of
      issues to help you configure the pipeline. </p>
    <p>To help configure the pipeline, you can also perform a data preview to view how the pipeline
      transforms source data.</p>
    <p>When you start a pipeline, the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> runs the
      pipeline until you stop pipeline or shut down the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. While the
      pipeline runs, you can monitor the pipeline and configure alerts to verify that the pipeline
      performs as expected.</p>
