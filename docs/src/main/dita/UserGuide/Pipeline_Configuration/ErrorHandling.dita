  <title>Error Record Handling</title>
  <shortdesc>You can configure error record handling at a stage level and at a pipeline level. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p><indexterm>error record handling<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>When an error
      occurs as a stage processes a record, the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> handles
      the record based on the stage configuration. One of the stage options is to pass the record to
      the pipeline for error handling. For this option, the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> processes
      the record based on the pipeline error record handling configuration. </p>
    <p>When you configure a pipeline, be aware that stage error handling takes precedence over
      pipeline error handling. That is, a pipeline might be configured to write error records to
      file, but if a stage is configured to discard error records, those records are discarded. You
      might use this functionality to reduce the types of error records that are saved for review
      and reprocessing. </p>
    <p>Note that records missing required fields do not enter the stage. They are passed directly to
      the pipeline for error handling.</p>
