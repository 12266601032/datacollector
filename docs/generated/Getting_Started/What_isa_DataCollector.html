  <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> is a
  lightweight, powerful engine that streams data in real time. Use the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> to route and
  process data in your data streams. </p>

  <p class="p">To define the flow of data for the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>, you configure
   a <dfn class="term">pipeline</dfn>. A pipeline consists of stages that represent the origin and destination
   of the pipeline, and any additional processing that you want to perform. After you configure the
   pipeline, you click Start, and the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> goes to work. </p>

  <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
      processes data when it arrives at the origin and waits quietly when not needed. You can view
      real-time statistics about your data, inspect data as it passes through the pipeline, or take
      a close look at a snapshot of data. </p>

  <p class="p">A <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> runs
   one pipeline at a time. Install a <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> for each
   pipeline that you want to run. </p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">How should I use the Data Collector?</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> like a pipe in
  the data stream. Throughout your enterprise data topology, you have streams of data that you need
  to move, collect, and process on the way to their destinations. The <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> provides the
  crucial connection between hops in the stream. </p>

  <p class="p">You can use a single <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> or an array of
    <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s to solve
   your ingest dilemmas.</p>

  <p class="p">For example, you might install a single <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> to stream
      log file data from a web server to HDFS. Or, you might install an array of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s to stream
      data from discrete files into a Kafka cluster. </p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_bl5_dl4_1r">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">How does this really work?</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Let's walk through it...</p>

  <p class="p">After you install the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>, you launch
   the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> window,
   log in, and create your first pipeline. </p>

  <p class="p">What do you want it to do? Let's say you want to read CSV files from a directory and remove the
   newline characters before writing it to Hive. To do this, you start with a Directory origin stage
   and configure it to point to your source files. (You can also have the stage archive processed
   files and write files that were not fully processed to a separate directory for review.)</p>

  <p class="p">To remove the newline characters, connect Directory to an Expression Evaluator processor and
   configure it to remove the newline character from the last field in the record.</p>

  <p class="p">To write to Hive, you connect the Expression Evaluator to a Hadoop FS destination stage. You
   configure the stage to write the data as a JSON object (though you can write it as delimited data
   as well). </p>

  <p class="p">You preview data to view source data move through the pipeline and notice that some fields have
   missing data. So you add a Value Replacer to replace null values in those fields. </p>

  <p class="p">Now that the data flow is done, you configure the pipeline to save records that cannot be
   processed correctly and configure an email alert to let you know when the pipeline generates more
   than 100 bad records. Then, you start the pipeline and the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> goes to work. </p>

  <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
   window goes into Monitor mode and displays summary and error statistics immediately. To get a
   close look at what's going on, you take a snapshot of the pipeline so you can examine how a set
   of data passed through the pipeline. You can also inspect data - configure rules to provide
   details about data as it moves from stage to stage - and configure rule-based alerts. </p>

  <p class="p">And what about those bad records being saved? They're saved with error details. The <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> can move them
   to an external directory so you can create an error pipeline to reprocess that data. Voila!</p>

  <p class="p">The <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> is a
   powerful tool, but we're making it as simple as possible to use. So give it a try, click the Help
   icon for information, and call us if you need a hand. </p>
