#The format is
#  <username>: <password>[,<rolename> ...]
#
# Currently we support only one role, 'user', don't change the 'user' at the end,
#

# For admin/admin with form authentication:
admin: MD5:21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3,user

# For admindigest/admin with digest authentication:
admindigest: MD5:197e33015713c0a1d36db5dfc36a0507,user

#
# To compute the MD5 run the following command:
#
# OSX:
#    (For http.authentication=form)
#      $ echo -n "<password>" | md5
#
#    (For http.authentication=digest)
#      $ echo -n "<username>:<realm>:<password>" | md5
#
# Linux:
#    (For http.authentication=form)
#      $ echo -n "<password>" | md5sum
#
#    (For http.authentication=digest)
#      $ echo -n "<username>:<realm>:<password>" | md5sum
#
#
# The default realm is 'local-realm'
#
