demo: MD5:7cb57baa476441edb32a8d4825df55ba,user

#
# To compute the MD5 run the following command:
#
# OSX:
#    (For http.authentication=form)
#      $ echo -n "<password>" | md5
#
#    (For http.authentication=digest)
#      $ echo -n "<username>:<realm>:<password>" | md5
#
# Linux:
#    (For http.authentication=form)
#      $ echo -n "<password>" | md5sum
#
#    (For http.authentication=digest)
#      $ echo -n "<username>:<realm>:<password>" | md5sum
#
#
# The default realm is 'local-realm'
