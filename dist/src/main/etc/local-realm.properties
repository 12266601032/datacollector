#The format is
#  <username>: <password>[,<rolename> ...]
#
# Currently we support only one role, 'user', don't change the 'user' at the end,
#

# For demo/lacucaracha with form authentication:
demo: MD5:7cb57baa476441edb32a8d4825df55ba,user

# For demodigest/lacucaracha with digest authentication:
demodigest: MD5:5faf539ab4dc413e63d527ede9bc180e,user

#
# To compute the MD5 run the following command:
#
# OSX:
#    (For http.authentication=form)
#      $ echo -n "<password>" | md5
#
#    (For http.authentication=digest)
#      $ echo -n "<username>:<realm>:<password>" | md5
#
# Linux:
#    (For http.authentication=form)
#      $ echo -n "<password>" | md5sum
#
#    (For http.authentication=digest)
#      $ echo -n "<username>:<realm>:<password>" | md5sum
#
#
# The default realm is 'local-realm'
#
